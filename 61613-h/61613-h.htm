<h2>MAURICE BOUCHOR.</h2>

<p>Maurice Bouchor was born at Paris in 1855.</p>

<p>Bouchor is a dramatic poet of rare inspiration and
tragic depth. His best-known long plays, “Tobie,”
“Noël,” and “Les Mystères d’Eleusis,” are, in the
words of an eminent French critic, “among the most
beautiful works of our time.” “Conte de Noël”—“A
Christmas Tale,” here translated for the first
time into English—is a charming little dramatic
episode. It was first performed at the Comédie
Française, in Paris, in 1895.</p>

<p>This play may be elaborately staged, but the detailed
stage-directions need not be faithfully adhered
to. The simplest of interiors and costumes may be
used.</p>

<h2>A CHRISTMAS TALE</h2>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>:—<i>A room of considerable size, serving at
once as living-room and studio. Everything is
simple, clean, and neat. To the right are
wooden statues of various kinds, some painted
in bright colors, but most of them unfinished.
Strewn about the floor are pieces of wood, large
blocks, and the like, together with chisels
and other implements. The statues of <span class="smcap">Saint
Nicholas</span> and <span class="smcap">Saint Rose</span>—actors dressed to
represent them—stand down-stage to the right,
close to each other. <span class="smcap">Saint Nicholas</span> is an old
man with a white beard, who wears the rich
costume of a bishop; <span class="smcap">Saint Rose</span>, little more
than a child, with roses in her hair, is dressed
like a saint of <span class="smcap">Fra Angelico</span>. There is a
door to the right, just behind these statues. To
the left is a large fire-place, in which are dying
embers; two children’s shoes lie on the hearthstone.
Nearby is the cradle—hung with curtains—in
which little <span class="smcap">Rose</span> is sleeping. At the
center of the stage is a table, with a meal set
on it, and a chair on either side. Through a
bay-window at the back are seen the silhouette
of the cathedral of Notre Dame and the roofs
of houses covered with snow. It is night, and
a few stars are out. On the mantel above the
fire-place burns a candle; two other candles,
half-burnt, are on the table. As the curtain
rises, <span class="smcap">Jacqueline</span> is seated on a chair. She sits
listening to a church bell which strikes five.
Then she rises.</i></p>

<div class="drama-container">
<div class="drama">
<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Jacqueline.</span>—</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis five o’clock, and Pierre is still away.</div>
<div class="verse">I thought I heard his step—but ’twas not his!</div>
<div class="verse">My dear good husband, once so kind, neglects</div>
<div class="verse">And leaves me all alone. Is it his fault?</div>
<div class="verse">What most I fear is that his weakness will</div>
<div class="verse">Destroy him! Now no doubt he sits and drinks</div>
<div class="verse">In some low wine-shop: thus he spends his nights.</div>
<div class="verse">My Pierre! My genius! Lord in Heaven, hear!</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>She looks at <span class="smcap">Rosette’s</span> shoes by the hearth.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse">I fear he’ll bring no presents for Rosette——</div>
<div class="verse">Her Christmas will be sad without her toys.</div>
<div class="verse">He wanted so to buy some toy to make</div>
<div class="verse">Her little eyes grow wide with wonder. See,</div>
<div class="verse">The tiny shoes stand empty Christmas morn,</div>
<div class="verse">And seem to say: “Has Christmas passed us by?”</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>A pause.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse">He took his mantle with him, he was going</div>
<div class="verse">To Notre Dame for midnight Mass. How tenderly</div>
<div class="verse">He kissed me, when he told me, “Good night, dear!”</div>
<div class="verse">I thought he would be hungry, so I put</div>
<div class="verse">A goodly supper on the table, while the fire</div>
<div class="verse">Glowed bright, and through the windows I could see</div>
<div class="verse">The lights of Notre Dame, and hear the organ</div>
<div class="verse">And the choir. My heart was light with joy</div>
<div class="verse">At thought of his return, when we might talk</div>
<div class="verse">And I might influence and make him good:</div>
<div class="verse">I understand him and can soothe him well.</div>
<div class="verse">Now statues occupy him more than I.</div>
<div class="verse">For days and days his silence is unbearable——</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>She looks at the statues of <span class="smcap">Saint Nicholas</span> and <span class="smcap">Saint Rose</span>.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse">Yet I am proud of these wood images——</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<div class="verse">My Pierre is no mere artisan or ’prentice;</div>
<div class="verse"><i>He</i> cuts a living face from living oak.</div>
<div class="verse">I must stand back and silently admire,</div>
<div class="verse">Stand mute with fear. His art is wife and child</div>
<div class="verse">For him. How sad I am that the lost hours</div>
<div class="verse">Spent at the inn cannot be mine! Oh, God!</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>She kneels before the statues.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse">Monsieur Saint Nicholas, Madame Saint Rose,</div>
<div class="verse">You whom my Pierre has graven, pardon me</div>
<div class="verse">If I dare speak to you—I suffer so!</div>
<div class="verse">You’ve always been so good, so kind to me!</div>
<div class="verse">Ah, Saints of Paradise, give back my Pierre.</div>
<div class="verse">Comfort, console me, if you value him!</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>She rises.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse">He’s not yet home. I am so tired out!</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>She goes to <span class="smcap">Rosette’s</span> cradle and looks at the sleeping child.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse">She sleeps a sound soft sleep. Oh, may God grant</div>
<div class="verse">That I be spared you, little one, my sweet!</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>She turns toward <span class="smcap">Saint Rose</span>.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse">I give her to your keeping while I rest,</div>
<div class="verse">To you, her patron saint.</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>She looks again at <span class="smcap">Rosette</span>.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse indent13">I dare not kiss her,</div>
<div class="verse">She must sleep on in peace.—Now will I lay</div>
<div class="verse">A pillow for her.</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>She carefully arranges the pillow in the cradle.</i>)</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<div class="verse indent9">Sleep in peace, my dear!</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>A pause.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse">Shall I? Dare I? Yes, I must.</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>She kisses <span class="smcap">Rosette</span>.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse indent15">There, my child.</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>She sits in a chair at some distance from the cradle, closes her eyes, and is soon fast asleep. A moment later she speaks as in a dream.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse">I see her now the day she was baptized,</div>
<div class="verse">I have not smiled so much since that glad time.</div>
<div class="verse">My Pierre forgets me, spends his nights away</div>
<div class="verse">In drinking——</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>A rather long pause.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse indent8">Dear Saint Nicholas, I pray,</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, give me rest—make me forget awhile——</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>The Statue of <span class="smcap">Saint Nicholas</span> moves. A bright light floods the room. <span class="smcap">Saint Nicholas</span> comes slowly toward <span class="smcap">Jacqueline</span>, and extends a hand to her.</i>)</div>

<div class="direction">(<i>She falls asleep again. <span class="smcap">Saint Nicholas</span> looks at her, smiling benignantly, then turns to the statue of <span class="smcap">Saint Rose</span>.</i>)</div>

<div class="verse">Rose, Rose! No answer from her! Rose, I’m speaking!</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<div class="verse">You hear me? Come to life!</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>He examines the statue, which remains inanimate.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse indent13">’Tis surely she!</div>
<div class="direction">(<i>He turns round facing the audience, while the statue of <span class="smcap">Saint Rose</span> begins to move. She quietly walks toward <span class="smcap">Saint Nicholas</span> and listens to him.</i>)</div>
<div class="verse">From Heaven have we come to save Jacques Coeur.</div>
<div class="verse">He ’graved my image for the joy it gave him,</div>
<div class="verse">No gain was his—and yet he leaves his wife!</div>
<div class="verse">I hope that we can save him——</div>
<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Saint Rose.</span>—</div>
<div class="verse indent16">Nicholas?</div>
<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Saint Nicholas.</span>—</div>
<div class="verse">Ah, Rose! You’re late.</div>
<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Saint Rose.</span>—</div>
<div class="verse indent11">Because I’ve been to see</div>
<div class="verse">The children who have never been baptized</div>
<div class="verse">And giv’n them Christmas cakes, and flow’rs and kisses.</div>
<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Saint Nicholas.</span>—</div>
<div class="verse">But the angels all do that, my dear Saint Rose,</div>
<div class="verse">And one of them stands guard before the gate.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Saint Rose.</span>—</div>
<div class="verse indent17">Yes——</div>

<div class="verse">The toys you should have brought—Where are they, Rose?</div>
<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Saint Rose.</span>—</div>

<p class="center larger">THE WORLD’S BEST PLAYS<br />
<span class="smaller">By Celebrated European Authors</span></p>

<p class="center">A NEW SERIES OF AMATEUR PLAYS BY THE BEST
AUTHORS, ANCIENT AND MODERN, ESPECIALLY
TRANSLATED WITH HISTORICAL NOTES, SUGGESTIONS
FOR STAGING, Etc., FOR THE
USE OF SCHOOLS, COLLEGES, AND
DRAMATIC CLUBS</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap larger">Barrett H. Clark</span><br />
General Editor</p>

<p>With the immensely increased demand for new
plays for purposes of production by amateurs
comes a correspondingly great demand for a careful
selection of those plays which can be easily
and well presented by clubs and colleges. The
plays in the present series have been chosen with
regard to their intrinsic value as drama and literature,
and at the same time to their adaptability to the needs and
limitations of such organizations.</p>

<p>The Series, under the personal supervision of Mr. Barrett H.
Clark, instructor in the department of Dramatic Literature at
Chautauqua, New York, assistant stage manager and actor with
Mrs. Fiske (season 1912-1913), now comprises ten volumes, and fifteen
more will make their appearance during the year. Eventually
there will be plays from ancient Greece and Rome, Italy, Spain,
France, Russia, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries, representative
of some of the best drama of all ages and lands.</p>

<p>Each volume is prefaced by a concise historical note by Mr. Clark
and with a few suggestions for staging.</p>
